# SETUP

- Python (PIP)
  - Open cmd and go to the fastdex folder using CD on windows or linux and run the following command.
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - (Only is discord pip req.)

- Discord Developer Portal
  - 1- Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
  - 2- Create new application.
  - 3- Go to bot options (in the bot) and enable messages, presence, and server intents.
  - 4- Go to the install option and copy the installation link using the option (Discord Provide Link).
    - Example: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOTID
  - 5- Paste it into any Discord or web channel and add it to your apps.
  - 6- Host your bot and in the last line of the PY file change `YOUR BOT TOKEN` with your Discord bot token.
  - 7- Once you've done all this and added the app to your Discord account, simply go to a random channel on Discord server you want and run /spamcustom `THE_TEXT_YOU_WANT`

# IMPORTANT  

- The creator of this bot is not responsible for misuse.
- In order for the bot to be able to spy on that channel, it must be enabled "Use external applications". This comes by default in any discord channel. Be careful with this on your Discord server.
